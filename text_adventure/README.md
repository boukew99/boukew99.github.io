So the hero defeated the dragon after all and got into the castle back again with large applause from all the citizens living in the castle! They were overjoyed by their new gained freedom now that the rein of the dragon was gone. You get a message from a courier.

You cannot refuse such an offer and take the courier as your guide to the king. Finally you arrive after walking many stairs with the king sitting in its throne. He quickly dispells the discussion he was having after gazing your entry.
