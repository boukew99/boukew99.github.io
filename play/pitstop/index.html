<h2>üè∞The Gate</h2>
<p>You approach the gate of Pitstop. Two guardsüíÇüíÇ are waiting in front, sharply investigating your approach. Halt! What business do you have? I explain that I am the new project manager and show the paper with the kings seal on it. The guards inspect the paper and briefly look a bit concerned at each other. Okay you may come in. The gate opens and you walk inside into a deserted town.<p>
