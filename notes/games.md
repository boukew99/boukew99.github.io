# Games

Packaging a joyful process.

## Story

The first thing you think of when making a story in games is one where the player can make his own story. That would be the ultimate freedom. However a game is not real life, the story has to be scoped. Then there are a 2 kinds of story. A creative and responsive story. 

### Creative story

Since creation of the story is led by the player, you will not have much influence on what it will be. Thus you can't build on it, it will be emergent from the gameplay and totally unique for each player. For the game to be flexible to all these stories, the actors have to be lightweight and not invested in any deep plots. 

### Responsive story

The player has no choice here the story exist and the player can respond to it in a way he sees fit. The main interactivity here comes from limited persepective.
[Ghost Pattern used this kind of story.](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/deep-dive-dissecting-the-simultaneous-storytelling-in-wayward-strand)

> Our theory was that by limiting player agency and not allowing the player to have a big impact on the stories, that would open up design space within the world itself; weâ€™d be able to create interesting, overlapping stories that are reactive to the player, while not requiring an impossible amount of branching that takes into account the player making choices that cause sweeping changes to the stories. 

### 3 way story

Have 3 parralel story tracks with switches between them.

### Hyperstory

A internet story linked with hypertext.

## The Introduction Screen

This sets you up for the experience. Here you introduce the title, configurations, audio and visuals in just one screen! The player can decide when they are ready to play. In the next screen you can show some context/story/instruction text.

## Applied Games

Games are some of the most fun people have and have big attraction. Some smart people got the bright idea to use this enjoyment to teach people something more applied. This can be basic math or grammar. If more focus is put on the simulative nature, then it can be used for trainings, such as in the military. Though you always **apply** game technology instead of enjoyment. 
It also has different names, such as Serious Games or Game+, which is how this course is called, but I think this name is more descriptive and obvious. 

### Combining the Fun and Learning

This seems like such an easy thing, and it is, but it is also very fragile. Once the game becomes to serious all fun will be lost. Unfortunaly the school system is often too serious about the things that we learn, eventhough we often forget what we learned soon after. 
There is also the book where is stated that the learning process is what makes the game fun. This is what we should acknowledge, what we learn is not where the fun lies, but just in the process itself. That is why a game without application can still be fun, eventhough learning how to jump in a video game has not much application outside the game.
Then how do does the learning process work? It is a simple feedback loop where you see what the game outputs based on your input. Lets call it the motor-sensor loop, where your motor input comes back through your senses after a short detour through the computer.

### Theory

All theory discussed will likely arise from the motor-sensor loop.

## Dialog recursion

Popups opening dialog popups all over the screen until solved, then go back to previous unsolved.

## Game+

Game-based learning, making learning serious topics fun.

Game-flow can work on a psychologocial and physiological level.

Story is the connection to the real world, it can be as short as a title.

Killers->Achievers-->Socializers-->Explorerers->Inclusivity of play with all actors
