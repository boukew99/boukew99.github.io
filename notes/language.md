## Poems

# 

```
As the fields sows
so reaps the mows
```

```
As un yields
The soul feels
```

```
The ware is soft
But can be structurally hardend
Like a rock
Which is not very malleable
Unlike thought
Limiting its freedom
```

```
 🐣 🐥 🐤 🐔 🥚 🐣 - 🐮 🥛 - 🌻 + 🌞 = ?
```

```
oh friction
why are you in my way
am I unoiled
for joy is the way
```

```
from pure idea
to messy implementation
test for true feedback
and evolve again
```

> the pure idea, the messy implementation, the true feedback

```
pen & paper
pan & fire
game & rules
boat & water
chair & butt
human & earth
```
