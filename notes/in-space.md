# In Space

Life on earth could have only evolved to such sophistatication, because of protection from all harshness of outer space. Gravity, food, water, warmth, none of these can be taken for granted anymore, though we still depend on them, even if in outer space.

## Microgravity

Presense of a small gravitational force compared to earths' standard.

```
F = G (M m)/r^2

M = The mass of the earth = 5,98 * 10^24 kg
G = The universal gravitational constant = 6,67 * 10^-11 m3 kg^-1 s^-2
g(r) = (G M)/r^2
F_earth ≈ g(r) * m

R0 = The average equatorial radius of the earth = 6,371 * 10^6 m
F ≈ 9.816 * m

g(∞) ≈ 0
```

Since gravity is never zero, the concept of free fall is only relative, therefore we can achieve it on earth! This relativity is assumed when space  & time of the objects are equal since then `velocity = g ⋅ t` will be equal, avoiding any air resistance.
