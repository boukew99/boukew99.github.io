## Interaction
First of is navigation. This will simply be solved by scrolling. Though not all content needs to be always loaded thus scrolling is combined with links, which indicate what you want load, which will take you to that page. These rules set up the constraints for page design. First every loaded element is visibile otherwise it cannot be accesed by scrolling. Though you don't want to do too much scrolling so organize the page with care. Second, divide you website into functional pages, so the user has to do minimal loading and can acces the page independently (from anywhere). Try to provide a header (with #header) link too for an external links too provide extra context.

Then once we need a form for user input, then just use the provided `<input>` HTML, which needs differnt interaction depending on input type.

Downward/sideway flow only. going up means you did not find what you want.

## Source
Since I use just HTML & CSS & JS, you can inspect(F12) the page to see the source, since it is the source.

### Code Transparency
Every webpage has to send its code to be rendered, so everything you see is code that is send. This you can `Inspect` by pressing f12 in the browser (or in the context menu).
