# Portfolio
I develop software, music, drawings, papers with a focus on usability and inclusivity.  

## Software projects
Most software is hosted on my [Github](https://github.com/boukew99).

### Godot Assets
💻 Generally I use the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) for native development or its small binary size and ease of use. I have made some repos available on the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset?category=&godot_version=&sort=updated&filter=boukew99), which are all hosted on [Github](https://github.com/boukew99).These videogames are hosted on [Itch.io](https://howyoudoing.itch.io/) and , which includes Game Jam games, demos and experiments.
