# Math
I'm not sure yet what math totally encompasses.

## Data
All mata will eventually translate into just data. This is what makes math concrete and thus real. A line will always have points otherwise there is no line.

## Higher order defining
Though this concreteness has its limitations and it becomes a lot of work to store a line by noting down its points. This is only feasible for a small range with a low level of detail, so variables come to the rescue! Say `x` is any number. Then `y = x` is just a line that goes up like 1,2,3... or down like -1,-2,-3... till infinity♾️ if we don't tell it stop. Have you ever seen an infinite line? No, so then it cannot be real. Only when you define `x` does it become real. And `x` can be any number or numbers, so it could be 4 or 9 or 1 till 100 and these will all give different `y` outcomes. But they are all correct and on the same line we defined.

# Making math with math
At the beginning there was `+`, describing the additive flow of the universe. This was probably just used with small positive numbers. 
Then came negative numbers `-x`, indicating the equilibrium. Water flow means that in one point it becomes less and at another point it becomes more.
Then we became lazy and instead of working with totals we split numbers up in groups. `x * y` instead of calculating their total. Thus 5 + 5 + 5 could be shortly written as 5 * 3, since there are 3 5's. You dont have to duplicate your additions.
But then we had groups, meaning we can divide numbers. So to know how many groups, we use division `total / x`.
So then we became even lazier and came up with `power ^`. 5 * 5 * 5 could just be written as 5^3, because you have 3 times a 5 multiplication!
