	<h2>Project review</h2><p>I have done many programming projects and many of them end up just being learning experiences, which are then integrated in my other projects. A few stand the test of time as standalone applications, which are described below. Some projects have been published or only preserved via screenshots. Might be fun to look back and see what I learned from them and now.</p>
	<h3>Hello Python</h3>
	<p>My first connection with programming. I mean remember being intoxicated by all the possible combinations you could make with pytons syntax and thinking I never would have to solve something manually.</p>
	<h3>Hello GameMaker</h3>
	<p>Before I was already interested in game logic/design and the graphical nature of it, so I tried to learn and make games in GameMaker, but I never really got into it.</p>
	<h3>Hello Godot</h3>
	<p>Then I met Godot and though being somewhat strange it had a certain simplicity and openess, which made me interested in the technologies behind it. I read all the blogs dilligently, not understanding much of the technical terms, but still learning. I ended up with learning a lot of the different approaches to programming, but ulitmately honed the code simplicity where leveraged almost all behavior with the provided nodes. I particulary liked desiging minimal User Interfaces with the container class. This produced some opensourced addons and demos. There are also some 2D games for game jams lying around.</p>
	<h4>Scratch Animator</h4>
	<p>I got interested in animation techniques, effective art styles, production and supportive technology. The productions of Studio Ghibli have many details integrated, but are enormosly intensive to make. With ponyo they used a simplfied art style to give more detail to the animations instead of the image, but the reception was mixed. How can you produce a pure animative experience without comprimising on visual image needs, while also being condensely packed? Looom got an interesting approach where they only support <bold>weave animations</bold>. Their app seemed approachble from a usability standpoint and people where happy with it, so I thought to create my own specific tool and workflow with the new found knowledge of User interface Nodes in Godot. Loosly taken inspirations from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=s26ze13m">Behind the Design: Looom</a> and <a href="https://www.iorama.studio/looom-user-guide">Loom user guide</a>. The <a href="scratch-animator/scratch_animator.tar.gz"source file is available</a>, which also includes the latest scratch_canvas addons.</p>
	<h4>Mondriaan Maker</h4>
	<p>A creative program with a minimal user interface.

		<h5>Inception</h5>
		<p>Before Mondriaan Maker there was resizable rectangles. It was a fixed size of 3 by 3 rectangles each expanding, but their edges resizable. The next step was adding colors to the rectangles. By accident I made something that reminded me of an Mondriaan painting, and so I applied an mondriaan palette. Then came the infinite rectangles update, scaling up the possibilities of programm. It took some time to polish the interaction, but the coloring bar could be replaced by mutating colors and color dragging. The screenshot button could be replaced by an timed screenshot popup.</p>
		<h5>‚öôFeaturing Mechanics</h5>
		<p>Make you own art of any size in the accessible Mondrian style in under a minute (or longer). Practice the art of ratios and color relationships to tell stories of a place. See a demonstration video with timestamps indicating the features.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>infinite splitting by tapping</li>
			<li>random color mutation</li>
			<li>endless resizing with edge dragging</li>
			<li>recoloring with drag & dropping colors</li>
			<li>split erasing with black recoloring</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Hello C</h3>
	<p>I started noticing I often came up with implementations where I would need deeper acces to the Engines internals and even altering them. The engine shipped a lot of dead weight with each game I produced. Though it is minimal compared to other engines or apps, I still felt I could do better, especially if I want to export to the web. Thus <a href="b.c">hello C</a>! I protoyped responsive GUI with raylib and raygui, but struggled with the slow prototyping speed, coming up with more implementations than I could test, ultimately slowing to a halt.</p>
	<h3>Hello Web</h3>
	<p>That is basically this website. Web tech is better at handling than Game Engines, which focus more on video. Its universal nature and mobility is also a big attraction, allowing it to be used on mobile and also easily share it. This website is basically the result of all the things I learned.</p>
