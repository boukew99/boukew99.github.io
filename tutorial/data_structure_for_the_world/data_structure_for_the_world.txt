Computers are really good at workin with a lot of data.
So then the question of how to store lots of data arises.
You might now tables or lists.
But the one that matters most is the tree structure.
This is the only data structure you need. Anymore complex and it cannot be read anymore, any simpler is a derivation of this structure.
this structure naturally comes to be when you cut up the world in smaller and smaller pieces.
And once you know it you can see it everywhere.

Then the types of data that means anything is the input you get via the senses.

When you combine this with tree data structure for a computer, you get an object with the aspect of visuals, sound and haptics.


With this you can represent about anything in data.
