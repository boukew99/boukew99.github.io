# 1D GUI
Text is 2D as it is displayed in 2 dimensions. 
But mechanically it works in 1D, since there is only way to read.
This makes the sequential processof reading simple.
This can be also be leveraged in GUI application layouts to make it user friendlier.

## 1D GUI rules (same as text)
* fill width
* variable length
