## Common elements

-favicon
-style

## Page structure

Next links at end.

## Content
Functional filing. Need a page -> create HTML or MD. Add structure inside page with headers and bold text. Add & integrate media in folder with same name. Extend pages with HTML inside folder with same name. Repeat.

## Linking

Hierarchical zooming (`Go back` for undo)

## Overview & Zooming

When a user enters your site they should get an overview of the page. Minimize scrolling, to minimize overview time. Then the user can decide where to **zoom** for more information. Zooming can be done by loading a new page, as happens on the web when you click a hyperlink, or it could be a smooth zoom, such as on digital maps, which dynamically load in more details as you zoom in, to give you a new overview. Preferably you only want to zoom in, since zooming out means you did not find what you looked for. 

## Interaction

Divide you website into complete distinct pages, so the user has to only load one page and can acces it independently (from any website). Then once we need a form for user input, then just use the provided `<input>` HTML, which needs differnt interaction depending on input type. 

## Source Transparency

The source is fully transparent, since only HTML & CSS & JS is used. This you can inspect(F12).

## Breadcrumb
History navigation feedback, with preview of data to be sent
[x]() / [y]() / [z]()
Breadcrumbs come from the fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel, where Hans left a trail of breadcrumbs to find hisway back. This page also uses the same concept, but here it is for <a href=<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_navigation>navigating</a> the internet for a particular intention. Functionally it works like a query of several different sources, packed nicely in a list. -> as details tree in Records

## Recylce Memory

How to cleanup memory after usage? Maybe you want to get back to it and determing when you are done with it is difficult. Only when you are done with a task do you know you can `close all` for that task. But inbetween you might run out of space too, especially if it is a long task üòÆÔ∏è. Therefore, I propose a limited memory space, which you are comfortable using. This will force you to recycle memory spaces if you go over your limit. You can then choose wether you are finished with the task in that memory space or if the new task is more important than the old one. An example could be to set a maximum on browser tabs. You can try it out already by enforcing it yourself.
