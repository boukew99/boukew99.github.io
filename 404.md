# 404 - File not found
Where we end up might not always be where we wanted to go. The site configured at this adress does not contain the requested file.

[look upstream](..)


If you want you can leave an [issue](https://github.com/boukew99/boukew99.github.io/issues), though I will probably come around to it eventually. 

Or it could be an issue with [Github's Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/) / [@githustatus](https://twitter.com/githubstatus).
