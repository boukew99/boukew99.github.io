# 404 - File not found ðŸ¤·
> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ Even on the internet most is just void.

Look for a local [index](index.html) or else look [upstream](..) or go directly to the [homepage](/).

> The site configured at this adress does not contain the requested file.

Q&A you might need:
- Where we end up might not always be where we wanted to go. 
- This site is empty?
- A moment of reflection.
- A place to take a breather of all the commotion on the internet.
- This is not what you were looking for?


If you want you can leave an [issue](https://github.com/boukew99/boukew99.github.io/issues), though I will probably come around to it eventually. 

Or it could be an issue with [Github's Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/) / [@githustatus](https://twitter.com/githubstatus).
