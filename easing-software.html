<body><header><h1> Easing Software Development</h1>
<p>The software development is one of the most uncooperative experiences, because a computer is the ultimate employee. It does exactly what it is told. However it can only understand exact instructions, so you have to tell it how to do it, to an degree that you could almost do it yourself already. Thus started the layering of abstractions, to control this one with a couple commands. In order to make it simpler I propose Extra-Ordinary Programming. This gives easy access and low maintainability cost, which naturally produces reuse. </p></header><main>

<h2>Functional Foldering</h2>
<p>How to organize your files? It is obvious that if you get too many files, that you need a folder to bundle files. This also allows to load files recursively on the needed context. But then there are many ways to organize the files into folders. The easiest way is by matching the file and folder together. This effectively creates an tree data structure with files as branching points. This constraints the freedom of file organizement in a constructive manner, allowing for inclusive expansion of files, making for a iterative file organizing process.</p>
<h3>Foldering Ergonomics</h3>
<p>When foldering the ergonomics are determined by the minimal changes of file-path length between navigation. Here file path follows a pattern of <code>base/page.extension</code>. This can be deepend by <code>base/page-folder/page.html</code> where page-folder can conveniently have the same name as the page.</p>
<h3>File Handlings</h3>
<p>In order to open files a handle is needed. Computers handles are not meaningful for humans thus we add a name to the handle.</p>
<h4>File extensions</h4>
<p>Every file is just stored as binary, thus file extensions don't matter for storing files. They specify how to open a file.</p>
<h4>File paths</h4>
<p>If your file paths are locally defined with functional foldering, then the filesystem will become self-organzing. You should expect filepaths like <code>page/file.extension</code> with a few shared exepetions.</p>
<h2>Evolving Software</h2>
<p>Over the years software has evolved from machine code too high-level languages and engines or editors. How can this progression be supported through individual codebases?</p>
<h3>Bottom-up development</h3>
<p>When desining software or computer games, you might know the pain of implementing such an idea. Software is still very limited in its freedom compared to human language, which is what we use to explain the original idea. A sensible approach then is to start from the software and find out what those systems can express. This makes it an explorative approach, which inherently makes it less plannable. Though software this approach suits software well, since it evolutionary and often iterative.</p>
