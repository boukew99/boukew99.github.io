<body><header><h1> Easing Software Development Page</h1>
<p>The software development is one of the most uncooperative experiences, because a computer is the ultimate employee. It does exactly what it is told. However it can only understand exact instructions, so you have to tell it how to do it, to an degree that you could almost do it yourself already. Thus started the layering of abstractions, to control this one with a couple commands.</p></header><main>

<h2>Functional Foldering</h2>
<p>How to organize your files? It is obvious that if you get too many files, that you need a folder to bundle files. This also allows to load files recursively on the needed context. But then there are many ways to organize the files into folders. The easiest way is by matching the file and folder together. This effectively creates an tree data structure with files as branching points. This constraints the freedom of file organizement in a constructive manner, allowing for inclusive expansion of files, making for a iterative file organizing process.</p>
