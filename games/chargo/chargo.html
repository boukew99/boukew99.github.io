<h2 id="start">Chargo al Forest</h2>
<p>Welcome in the mysterious forest of Chargo. The trees in this forest always peak out over the misty clouds drifting through the plants on the ground. Spread out are houses and sheds, some with smoke coming from the chimney, some crumbling and abandoned. Its is bordered with an abrupt end of the tree line, transitioning immediately into damp grassland. From far away you can see a bright red gate, inviting you to enter its path into this place. You stand before the gate and wonder if you shall enter by <a href="#walk-through">Walking through it</a> or by <a href="#walk-around">Walkin around it</a>.
<hr>
<p id="walk-through">You walk through the gate and feel the atmoshpere within you and the forest changing, like it is receiving you with open arms. It is said by the people living nearby in Yorkstead this forest leaves people changed after returning, not worse or better just deeper and more silent. <a href="#first path">Continue</a></p>
<hr>
<p id="walk-around">You walk around it. You got this feeling something went wrong, like you have not truly entered this place. Are you sure you don't want to <strong>walk through it</strong>? <a href="#walk-through">Yes</a>, <a href="#first path">No</a></p>

<h2 id="first path">First Steps</h2>
<p>The gravel path around the gate slowly turns into soft mud. It sticks to the your feet making a smacking sound with each step. Noticably there are other a footsteps before yours, many actually, of deer, racoons, foxes, birds and also people. Would all of them get in the forest the same way as you?</p>
