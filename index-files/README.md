## Overview & Zooming 
When a user enters your site they should get an overview of the page. Minimize scrolling, to minimize overview time. Then the user can decide where to **zoom** for more information. Zooming can be done by loading a new page, as happens on the web when you click a hyperlink, or it could be a smooth zoom, such as on digital maps, which dynamically load in more details as you zoom in, to give you a new overview. Preferably you only want to zoom in, since zooming out means you did not find what you looked for. 

## Interaction
Divide you website into functional pages, so the user has to do minimal loading and can acces the page independently (from anywhere). Try to provide a header (with #header) link too for an external links too provide extra context. Then once we need a form for user input, then just use the provided `<input>` HTML, which needs differnt interaction depending on input type. Downward/sideway file flow only. 


## Source Transparency
The source is fully transparent, since only HTML & CSS & JS is used. This you can inspect(F12).

## Recylce Memory
How to cleanup memory after usage? Maybe you want to get back to it and determing when you are done with it is difficult. Only when you are done with a task do you know you can `close all` for that task. But inbetween you might run out of space too, especially if it is a long task üòÆÔ∏è. Therefore, I propose a limited memory space, which you are comfortable using. This will force you to recycle memory spaces if you go over your limit. You can then choose wether you are finished with the task in that memory space or if the new task is more important than the old one. An example could be to set a maximum on browser tabs. You can try it out already by enforcing it yourself.
