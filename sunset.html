<body><h1>I am looking at the Sunset</h1>
<p>The colors it produces, almost like a rainbow, the sky keeps changing the further my eyes goes up. The sun cannot be directly seen, but the effect it has on the sky is perceivable with much distinction. As the sun keeps setting the colors intensity changes, becoming more dark, but also seeming relatively more full of color. I wish to capture this and share it with people, but my camera does not do it justice. I will just convert it to an  gradient, to scroll up and down on, wondering how the sun could make such a pattern. Waiting for the next day it shows this spectacle again.</p></body></html>
