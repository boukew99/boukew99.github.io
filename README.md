Landing page to various other places. I make software, which is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/boukew99) including some MIT Projects. My software has a focus on User Experience, which I can also use when making videogames. These videogames are hosted on [Itch.io](https://howyoudoing.itch.io/) and [Newgrounds](https://howyourdoing.newgrounds.com/), which includes Game Jam games, demos and experiments. Generally I use the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) for development and also have made some repos available on the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset?category=&godot_version=&sort=updated&filter=boukew99). In the [blog](blog) you can stay up to date with what I am up to. In [project](projects) I have a collection of most of my project on one page. In [tutorials](tutorials) you can learn what I have learned. I also keep a log of useful or intersting sites on [bookmarks](bookmarks). Or if your adventurous play this [text game](web_apps/text_adventure) on this site.
