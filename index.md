Landing page to various other places. I am on [Github](https://github.com/boukew99) with some MIT Projects. Some Godot Engine repos are made available on the
[Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset?category=&godot_version=&sort=updated&filter=boukew99). [Itch.io](https://howyoudoing.itch.io/) contains my Game Jam games, demos and experiments. Also here are the following general purpose assets I use, [sfx's pack](sound_pack/sound.zip) [(preview)](sound_pack/pack.ogg), [Bookxel font](bookxel.ttf), [icon pack](icon_pack/icon.zip) [(preview)](icon_pack/pack.png). You can view some random interesting [bookmarks](bookmark.md) or some crazy [definitions](definitions.md) I found. Also have guide for [scratch_animator](guide/scratch_animator.md)? Visit [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HowYouD09409170). Also trying [Newgrounds](https://howyourdoing.newgrounds.com/). This is the page you bookmark for quick access!
