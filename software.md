# Software
Dealing with memory.

## Inclusive or Universal Software
Some considerations
- Language is culture depedent and requires the effort of localization to transcend that.
- Effective programs with small size and computing requirements make it device independent. Mainly audio and visuals increase size. GPU calculation increase computing requirements.

### Games specific
- Only lock is your skill. Arcade games have this, but with upfront cost.
- Allow for own creative expansion/expression
- hospitality 
- kid friendly
