Trying Linux on 8GB USB

Apparently it is very easy to try Linux, all you need is an USB with 8 GB of storage. I tried Ubuntu and thus used this [installation tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview).

Then you plug in the USB with linux on it, stop the booting and redirect it to the USB and your using Linux. I expected it would be more difficult... 

Then how nice is it? Well, Ubuntu said somewhere it wanted to stay out of your way, and that is quite nice. Windows open in a empty space, so they don't overlap, images open with "best" zoom level and the presentation is just what you need, nothing more. The experience feels more responsive and at ease then Windows also. I tried some games that come pre-installed, like Mahjong and Mines and they are just plain old fun. I'm already a fan and will try it a bit longer to see if I could use it as a replacement on my old laptop or maybe on a new one.
