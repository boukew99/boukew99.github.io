# Human Computer Interaction

A human interacting with a human, disguished as a computer, independent of time. This field relies on the assumption that there is [hardware](hardware.md) to run on, which can take [input](input.md), process it with [software](software.md) and [output](output.md) an image or text. Note that this is not about computing, but about transmission of data, which could be a computation though. 

## Human

We all now them. You reading are also probably one! Though have you ever looked at how you do the things you do so effortlessly. We have been fine-tuned to many of the interaction we have in nature, because we are as much as part of it as we need it.

## Computer

The realm of 0's and 1's. Nature's law do not apply only logic is here. Though slowly through defining stable patterns do we grow closer to a familiar nature. This simple act of 2 inputs becoming 1 output branches out in patterns describing more complex patterns.

### Input



### Computing

### Output

This closes the loop as feedback on your input. 

## Interaction

Many things taken for granted are suddenly not present anymore in interaction with computers, compared to humans. These machine, so dumb, but untransparent at the same time. Often giving the frustation of unprogress.
