## Applied Games
Games are some of the most fun people have and have big attraction. Some smart people got the bright idea to use this enjoyment to teach people something more applied. This can be basic math or grammar. If more focus is put on the simulative nature, then it can be used for trainings, such as in the military. Though you always **apply** game technology instead of enjoyment. 
It also has different names, such as Serious Games or Game+, which is how this course is called, but I think this name is more descriptive and obvious. 

### Combining the Fun and Learning
This seems like such an easy thing, and it is, but it is also very fragile. Once the game becomes to serious all fun will be lost. Unfortunaly the school system is often too serious about the things that we learn, eventhough we often forget what we learned soon after. 
There is also the book where is stated that the learning process is what makes the game fun. This is what we should acknowledge, what we learn is not where the fun lies, but just in the process itself. That is why a game without application can still be fun, eventhough learning how to jump in a video game has not much application outside the game.
Then how do does the learning process work? It is a simple feedback loop where you see what the game outputs based on your input. Lets call it the motor-sensor loop, where your motor input comes back through your senses after a short detour through the computer.

### Theory
All theory discussed will likely arise from the motor-sensor loop.
