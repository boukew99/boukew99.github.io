# Programming languages

## Defining languages
1. terminals <>
2. non-terminals
3. rules
4. root

## Sequence Symbols
`-` connector
`.` end
`,` continue
`\n` `\t` `\s` space
`V_` variable, named

add, append, join `+`
subtract, negate, remove, filter `-`

## Mobile
There is little width space on mobile screen, which makes indenting and long lines of code unreadable. Next to that it has significant perfomance limitation. Thus no coding on mobile phones has happend yet. 

### Interprative wrapped code
To enable mobile programming a new syntax is required in the form of wrapped sequence combos. Normally one action happens per line, such as `var x = 5`. In a next line you will then use this variable. This can be combined into one sentence with `foo X = 5.`.
Notice the lack of `()`, because that requires less typing and reads easier. Also notice the `.` at the end, by writing wrapped sequence, we get closer to human language and can utilize that syntax too. That also why `X` is a capital letter, since we use that too denote names, which function much the same as variables here.
