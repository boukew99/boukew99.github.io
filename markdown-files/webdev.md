## Overview & Zooming 
When a user enters your site they should get an overview of the page. Minimize scrolling, to minimize overview time. Then the user can decide where to **zoom** for more information. Zooming can be done by loading a new page, as happens on the web when you click a hyperlink, or it could be a smooth zoom, such as on digital maps, which dynamically load in more details as you zoom in, to give you a new overview. Preferably you only want to zoom in, since zooming out means you did not find what you looked for. 

## Interaction
Divide you website into functional pages, so the user has to do minimal loading and can acces the page independently (from anywhere). Try to provide a header (with #header) link too for an external links too provide extra context. Then once we need a form for user input, then just use the provided `<input>` HTML, which needs differnt interaction depending on input type. Downward/sideway file flow only.
