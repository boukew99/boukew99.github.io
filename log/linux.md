# Trying Linux on 8GB USB
`20-05-22`
Apparently it is very easy to try Linux, all you need is an [USB](linux/linux_on_usb.svg) with 8 GB of storage. I tried Ubuntu and thus used this [installation tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview).

Then ![you plug in the USB with linux on it](linux/preview.webp), stop the booting and redirect it to the USB and your using Linux. I expected it would be more difficult... 

Then how nice is it? Well, Ubuntu said somewhere it wanted to stay out of your way, and that happens to be quite nice. Windows open in a empty space, so they don't overlap, images open with "best" zoom level and the presentation is just what you need, nothing more. The experience feels more responsive and at ease then Windows also. I tried some games that come pre-installed, like Mahjong and Mines and they are just plain old fun. I'm already a fan and will try it a bit longer to see if I could use it as a replacement on my old laptop or maybe on a new one.

Kind regards

PS:
- I Discovered you can take screenshots or record your screen with `fn + s`.
- Mouse speed with trackpad was too low for me, so I adjusted it up in the settings, but now I realised that there is some acceleration curve, though maybe a bit steep.

## Repairing Unbootable Linux
So one day you just wake up, open your computer, and start up linux, only to see that it does not start up for some reason you cannot make out(not sure what the command text means). The last line was something along the line of `reached target Bluetooth support`. Anyway, what to do? Let's see what `Ubuntu Advanced Options` means. It has a recovery mode? That might be what I need, [let's see what recovery mode is](https://linuxhint.com/boot-ubuntu-into-recovery-mode/). There are some option to fix what is going and then I remembered Ubuntu giving notifications about memory space getting full. Could that be it? It cleans some libraries, automatically selected. And yes! It boots normally again. So just keep calm and fix it! And next time maybe backup progress of 2 weeks!
