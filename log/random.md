A bit dry, but can easily be prepared fresh, which makes it good source of durative energy.


## Auto-off
What is the cost of a standby TV or wifi routers? Do you use them all the time? A TV maybe one hour per day, wifi routers not when you sleep. Still they are left on. The same for lights. The trade-off is only a bit of response time. Auto-off set with set time periods can make this trade-off neglible.

# Streaming
When streaming videos, you may want to consider changing the quality in the options menu. If the video does not need much detail or you listening more than watching, switch it to a lower video quality. This will save bandwith and energy.
