# No Mans Sky

So I got intersted in the procedural art of No Mans Sky after watching [No Man's Sky: How I Learned to Love Procedural Art](https://youtu.be/vcEA41eBOGs) and decided to give it a try. I did not try the crafting gameplay for long and switched to creative mode and got in the ship to explore this generated universe. 

I landed on this artic planet with a nice view of a [ringed planet](no-mans-sky/Screenshot 2022-05-13 222604.png) in the sky and then came across some procedural [plant slime animal](no-mans-sky/Screenshot 2022-05-13 223003.png). Turns out you can ride it and so I went [hopping](no-mans-sky/Screenshot 2022-05-13 223023.png) around on that thing. I also came across the [upper part of snake](no-mans-sky/Screenshot 2022-05-13 223315.png) that was walking upright, but without feet.

Then I had seen enough and went of to the [ringed planet with a speed 78,012 u/s](no-mans-sky/Screenshot 2022-05-13 224219.png) otherwise I would travelling for 6 hours or real time.

On the way I also used the camera mode to take some screenshots from the [spaceship](no-mans-sky/May-13@22.40.12.png) and its surroundings. Interestingly you could also control the sun, of which there was still only one. I used that to make an [eclpise](May-13@22.41.23.png).

And later watched some more talks about No Man's Sky including [Building Worlds in No Man's Sky Using Math(s)](https://youtu.be/C9RyEiEzMiU),
