## Overview & Zooming

When a user enters your site they should get an overview of the page. Minimize scrolling, to minimize overview time. Then the user can decide where to **zoom** for more information. Zooming can be done by loading a new page, as happens on the web when you click a hyperlink, or it could be a smooth zoom, such as on digital maps, which dynamically load in more details as you zoom in, to give you a new overview. Preferably you only want to zoom in, since zooming out means you did not find what you looked for. 

## Interaction

Divide you website into functional pages, so the user has to do minimal loading and can acces the page independently (from anywhere). Try to provide a header (with #header) link too for an external links too provide extra context. Then once we need a form for user input, then just use the provided `<input>` HTML, which needs differnt interaction depending on input type. Downward/sideway file flow only. 

## Source Transparency

The source is fully transparent, since only HTML & CSS & JS is used. This you can inspect(F12).

## Recylce Memory

How to cleanup memory after usage? Maybe you want to get back to it and determing when you are done with it is difficult. Only when you are done with a task do you know you can `close all` for that task. But inbetween you might run out of space too, especially if it is a long task üòÆÔ∏è. Therefore, I propose a limited memory space, which you are comfortable using. This will force you to recycle memory spaces if you go over your limit. You can then choose wether you are finished with the task in that memory space or if the new task is more important than the old one. An example could be to set a maximum on browser tabs. You can try it out already by enforcing it yourself.

## Email Events

Collect a mailing list for a topic or site, message them to say why to visit the website. Or on site change highlights, only users will know, new users won't care.

## italics

## Bottom-up development

When desining software or games, you might know the pain of implementing such an idea. Software is still very limited in its freedom compared to human language. A sensible approach is to start from the software and find interpretations of those systems. This makes it an explorative approach. Though software is quite suited for this, since software is self-building, evolutinairy and iterative. 

## Using keywords to standardize Ctrl-f

find what you need, like google search, but within a document.

* Figure/Table
* context dependent

## Details tree

- open by default

- tree conversation

## Input recording

and playback on a frame by frame basis.

## WIP

Share both completed work and, if possible, works-in-progress (WIP). Showcasing completed work is good, but showing process is even better. People are fascinated by construction; it also allows potential employers and clients to see how you work.
