# Code

## Morse code
Arguably one of the first digital code used by people, where dash(-) and long dask(---) are like the 0 & 1. Then by sequencing and spacing, it can represent more states , like 0101. With 26 states all the letters in the alphabet are covered and so we can transmit words, which can sequenced and spaced to create sentences and further if it was not such a pain to decipher it.

### Compression
Morse code is compressed by assigning the most used letters the shortest sequences as can be seen for the letter E ![in the figure](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/International_Morse_Code.svg).

## Programming language
Essentialy the computer only knows 0 and 1. Still we programm computers using names to point to higher level concepts. The first step for this was in Assembly with command such as ADD, which represented for example 0110. Nowadays we work with named variables and functions or even objects. At this level it becomes much like a (logical) language and thus we call it **a language that you can programm in**, a programming language. This gives the benefit of using familair language concepts to instruct the machine, which only knows machine language. So somewhere it must be translated back to 0 and 1's. For example, a easy to understand line of code could be `object.moveTo( table.position )`. 

### Flavours / Dialects
There are many languages with different specs each, though also many similarities. Each one speaks more to a certain use case and it is not clear if there is an universal best language. It is still a trade-off for what you need most, though many people also pick based on what fits their thinking style the most.

### Functional
The highest level using noble mathematical concept such as pure functions, which would be great, if getting it functional would more obvious. They are also lazy, which also sounds great, until you get a massive lag spike. This could likely be overcome with proper use, but it is another layer of complexity that you have to keep in mind when writing code, compared to the lower-level languages.

## Programming languages
But still coding :). no-context-languages.

### Defining languages
1. terminals <>
2. non-terminals
3. rules
4. root

### Sequence Symbols
`-` connector
`.` end
`,` continue
`\n` `\t` `\s` space
`V_` variable, named

add, append, join `+`
subtract, negate, remove, filter `-`

### Mobile
There is little width space on mobile screen, which makes indenting and long lines of code unreadable. Next to that it has significant perfomance limitation. Thus no coding on mobile phones has happend yet. 

#### Interprative wrapped code
To enable mobile programming a new syntax is required in the form of wrapped sequence combos. Normally one action happens per line, such as `var x = 5`. In a next line you will then use this variable. This can be combined into one sentence with `foo X = 5.`.
Notice the lack of `()`, because that requires less typing and reads easier. Also notice the `.` at the end, by writing wrapped sequence, we get closer to human language and can utilize that syntax too. That also why `X` is a capital letter, since we use that too denote names, which function much the same as variables here.


## Markdown
Marking with text in representative ways. It works in text only mode, but can be relatively easy translated to other formats, because of its generally well defined specs. Though that makes it also so, you don't get the full functionality of for example HTML.
