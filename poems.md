# Poems

```
As the fields sows
so reaps the mows
```

```
As un yields
The soul feels
```

```
The ware is soft
But can be structurally hardend
Like a rock
Which is not very malleable
Unlike thought
Limiting its freedom
```

```
 🐣 🐥 🐤 🐔 🥚 🐣 - 🐮 🥛 - 🌻 + 🌞 = ?
 ```
 
 ```
 oh friction
 why are you in my way
 am I unoiled
 for joy is the way
 ```
 
 ```
 from pure idea
 to messy implementation
 test for true feedback
 and evolve again
 ```
 
 > the pure idea, the messy implementation, the true feedback
 
 ```
 pen & paper
 pan & fire
 game & rules
 boat & water
 chair & butt
 human & earth
 ```
