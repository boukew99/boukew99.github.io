# Morse code
Arguably one of the first digital code used by people, where dash(-) and long dask(---) are like the 0 & 1. Then by sequencing and spacing, it can represent more states , like 0101. With 26 states all the letters in the alphabet are covered and so we can transmit words, which can sequenced and spaced to create sentences and further if it was not such a pain to decipher it.

## Compression
Morse code is compressed by assigning the most used letters the shortest sequences as can be seen for the letter E ![in the figure](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/International_Morse_Code.svg).
