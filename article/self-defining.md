# Self-Defining

## Fibonacci Sequence
Or 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
Or $$ F_n = F_n-1 + F_n-2 $$ <!--https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference-->

Or the golden ratio of 1.61803 39887
This sequence has intersting properies and defined by adding its previous value and its previous previous value. So it is defined by itself in the past. 

## Object
When is something a object. In terms of data structures it is often a encapsulation of sorts. Though often this data structure can just be reduces to a list, where its compents are independent of each other. Only when you define a value based on another property does encapsulation happen. So an object comes to be once it starts defining new properties from its own properties. Your hand being defined by the lower arm and them both again being defined by your upper arm, for example. It also correlates with what we think of a significance difference in size with vision.
