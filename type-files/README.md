## People

### Jane
Adventure women also on a journey. She is hanging out at the plaza looking for other travelers to chat too.

### Kathena
Has a total of 9 cats, though one went missing and missing posters are put around the whole town. It is one of the youngest cats, so she is a bit worried about his lone survival capabilities.

### Direk

## Town
The people that inhabitat it have the habitat of being individualistic. So the streets end up being pretty quiet when it is time for the kids to go home. Also, the network connections are few, though the whole town is one clique. Therefore they don't mind talking to strangers for a change in conversation.
