<body><header><h1>CyberKnup</h1>
<p>Knup in the Cyber world.</p>
</header><main>
<p>In the year 2100 many people have moved out of the cities to work upon the soil again. They became farmers which regenerated the sand to soil, though the process takes time and effort. Only a few remain in the cities of the earth, resulting in a filtered group of people, consisting of the disabled, rich and engineers. These cities are a hub for technology development, supporting the farmers with tech getting closerÂ  to biology each year. In turn, the farmers supply these old cities, concentrations of activities, with nutrion from the soil.
	In one of those cities Richie stays, a teenager enrolled in engineering class. He has been walking with a bionic lower leg from a young age. Customably made by his grandmother, a tinkerer of old technology, but engineering high-tech at work.</p>
