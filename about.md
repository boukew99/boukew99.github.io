## Native projects💻
Generally I use the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) for native development for its small binary size and ease of use. Software sources are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/boukew99) and playable demos on [itch.io](https://howyoudoing.itch.io/). Some of these are [Godot Engine Assets](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset?- category=&godot_version=&sort=updated&filter=boukew99).


## Video Games🎮  
Games are on [itch.io](https://howyoudoing.itch.io/), most of them are pretty experimental, since they are a learning experience. sample: [Space Evader👾](https://itch.io/embed-upload/2869595?color=ebdf64).
During Game jams I made space games, topdown sawblade simulator, perception game, chicken🐔 farm sim, puzzle box, light☀️ puzzle, platformers🤸‍♀️.
