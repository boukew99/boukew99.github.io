<body><header><h1>Project review</h1>
<p>I learned many things</p></header><main>
	<h2>Projects review</h2>
	<p>I have done many programming projects, but so many end up being just one thing. Then it is done, never to be opened again, just a learning experience. Some projects have been published or preserved or screenshotted. Might be fun to look back and see what I learned from them and now.</p>
	<h3>Hello Python</h3>
	<p>My first connection with programming. I mean remember being intoxicated by all the possible combinations you could make with pytons syntax and thinking I never would have to solve something manually.</p>
	<h3>Hello GameMaker</h3>
	<p>Before I was already interested in game logic/design and the graphical nature of it, so I tried to learn and make games in GameMaker, but I never really got into it.</p>
	<h3>Hello Godot</h3>
	<p>Then I met Godot and though being somewhat strange it had a certain simplicity and openess, which made me interested in the technologies behind it. I read all the blogs dilligently, not understanding much of the technical terms, but still learning. I ended up with learning a lot of the different approaches to programming, but ulitmately honed the code simplicity where leveraged almost all behavior with the provided nodes. I particulary liked desiging minimal User Interfaces with the container class. This produced some opensourced addons and demos. There are also some 2D games for game jams lying around.</p>
	<h4>Scratch Animator</h4>
	<p>I got interested in animation techniques, effective art styles, production and supportive technology. The productions of Studio Ghibli have many details integrated, but are enormosly intensive to make. With ponyo they used a simplfied art style to give more detail to the animations instead of the image, but the reception was mixed. How can you produce a pure animative experience without comprimising on visual image needs, while also being condensely packed? Looom got an interesting approach where they only support <bold>weave animations</bold>. Their app seemed approachble from a usability standpoint and people where happy with it, so I thought to create my own specific tool and workflow with the new found knowledge of User interface Nodes in Godot.</p>
	<h4>Mondriaan Maker</h4>
	<p>A project with an invisible user interface.</p>
	<a href="squash/squash.html">squash</a>
	<h3>Hello Web</h3>
	<p>That is basically this website. Web tech is better at handling than Game Engines, which focus more on video. Its universal nature and mobility is also a big attraction, allowing it to be used on mobile and also easily share it. This website is basically the result of all the things I learned.</p>
