# boukew99 README
boukew99 is a tiny website for testing web technologies for different receivers while striving for minimal code and good accesibility. All content serves mostly as placeholders for different use cases, while still being original. The structure should be obvious, altough maybe unorthodox. There are minimal repetitions, making each page mostly unique and keeping maintenance easier. Please enjoy <boukew99.github.io/>
