# boukew99 README
boukew99 is a tiny website for testing web technologies for different receivers while striving for minimal code and good accesibility. All content serves mostly as placeholders for different use cases, while still being original. The structure should be obvious, altough maybe unorthodox. There are minimal repetitions, making each page mostly unique and keeping maintenance easier. Please enjoy <https://boukew99.github.io/>.

## Technologies
- HTML, as meaningfull content binder
- CSS to personalize that meaning
- PHP for secure working with server files
- JS for transimitting interactive functionality

## Design
The site's structure is inspectable and transparent because the source is just HTML, CSS with JS only for interactivity. After transparency it is important to minimize data transport.

### Overview & Zooming Interaction
When a user enters your site they should get an overview of the page. Minimize scrolling, to minimize overview time. Then the user can decide where to **zoom** for more information. Zooming can be done by loading a new page, as happens on the web when you click a hyperlink, or it could be a smooth zoom, such as on digital maps, which dynamically load in more details as you zoom in, to give you a new overview. Preferably you only want to zoom in, since zooming out means you did not find what you looked for. 

### Search keywords
bold text (also headers).
