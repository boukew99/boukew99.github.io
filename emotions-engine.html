	<h2>Emotions in a logical environment</h2>
	<p>Computer software is an logical <strong>context-free language</strong>, there is only one way to interpret the meaning, independent of context. Though games have managed to evoke strong emotions in its players, which makes it stand out from other software applications. Those games are however made in the same environment as the rest of the applications, so how can they capture emotions so well? The trick is that the emotions are in-between the lines of code. This is why games are so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_Engine">mysteriously appealing</a> and tricky to get right. It depends heavily on the involvement of the player to trigger the emotions, because the code cannot do it.</p>
	<p>To make better videogames is to capture this emotion better. This requires cleaner minimal code, so the developers can iterate on the conditions of the gameplay that evoke the desired emotions.</p>

	<h3>Minimal programming context</h3>
	<p>C programming language has the most compatibilty with systems. Though development with it is slow for me. It's restricted context makes for an interesting challenge with huge portablity, small project size and easier paradigms as incentive.</p>
