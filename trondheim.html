	<h2>Cabin trip</h2>
	<p>As you know me, I went in almost blind into this trip. I barelyüòß took a duvet too sleep in. I forgot to charge my cheap phone and left with just 38% charge in the cold. Oh well. Met up with others from the group who knew the route. We had to cross the water with the ferry, which the bus drove on. From the other side we walked along side a car road for ~2 hours and took the deep snow path up the mountain for another ~2 hours. We at a split we took the left instead of the right way, I know stupid, but that took us too are more adventerous road with a hail storm and fast winds. Walking backwards meant you would not get hit in the face by ice.</p>

	<h2>Taco Friday</h2>
	<p>A true Norwegian cultural day of the week. Apparently they really like tacos (and also pizza). I was invited to one. I already looked Norwegian, now I know how to act like one. Only the language left to learn.</p>
	<h2>Moving in and out</h2>
	<p>It took one trip with the bus too move all my stuff to the new room, though my housemate, which I am leaving, helped me carry it.</p>
