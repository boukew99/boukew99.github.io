<input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="user"><br>

<a href=snow/index.html>Enter</a>
<div id=result></div>

<p>You enter a cold place with white light. Slowly your eyes adjust to view that the place is covered in pure snow. You see the door slowly closing. Do you <a href=../index.html>stay</a> or <a href=../index.html>return</a>?

<p>Hello. You see another person walking towards you. <a>Greet?</a>

<p>Excuse me. Could you help me out? My carrage got stuck in the mud and I need some help pushing it out. Do you have some time to help out an old man? <a href=>Yes</a>, <a>No</a>

<p>Thank you! You help the man and he gives you 20 coins as a kind gesture. I am riding to a town nearby, wanna join the ride? <a>Yes</a>

<p>You enter the town on the carriage and see kids and chikens running in the streets. The houses are risen in the center with surrounding fields of crops around it. The man points you to a inn to spend the night, since the sun is setting fast. The cost is 20 coins. Spend the night? Yes, No.
