# Environmental Psychology summary

After all this time, still no definition has been formed for the field. How can this be? I mean, if they can't even describe their own field, how can you describe your research? Well there are only two words in the name and "Psychology" is not the problem. So then "Environment", what is it? Where does it end, where does it begin? I don't see one. So how do you define something without form, with no end and begin? How do you use such a concept in your experiments? This is and has been the major confusement. I propose another word. *Situation*, which makes the field Situational Psychology. Now we already use this concept in daily life with much fruitfullnes. One thing that often is said is `we are in the same situation`. From this we can infer that situations are not always the same, thus they can be unique for each individual. This also means that the situation cannot be seperated from the person as the person determines the situation. Situations are also formed by some key aspect that is most relevant in the situation. As with danger, escape routes and hiding places are key. Unkwoningly much research already uses this concept and thus is not immediately invalided. Though the description of the specific situation in the experiment might be hidden or ill-described. So this summary becomes

## AN INTRODUCTION TO ECOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY by A.W. Wicker
It is recommended to read this before Barker, since this is supposed to be more accesbible than the original work of Barker.

So it started with just ecology, an biological science.

>Its guiding principle-that in the struggle for existence all organisms constantly interact with and adjust to an environement that includes other organisms as well as nonliving matter-is drawn from Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.

Though then they started measuring habitats and the interdependence of organisms (including humans) instead of enviroments, because even here environment is not defined.

> Organisms cannot be considered to exist or act in isolation.

Still we seperate the organism and its environment, which violates this assumption. The organism is also the environment, it cannot exist in isolation of the environment, which includes other organisms to which this organism is linked. 

### Ecological thinking in psychology
Lewin, the first to suggest the study of psychological ecology, relied on the **perceptions** of the environment of people, which can also be seen as the situation. Barker and Wright, young associates of Lewin, became ambitious and curious of what effects the actual features of the "environment" has on humans, proposing even a psychological-habits map. Thus reducing a human being to something that could simply be controlled through manipulating its environment. Next to that, how are you gonna control for the infinite features of an environment? Is this not a crime against humanity?

Then followed many attempts to capture "environment" by defining it most important features, like behavior settings.

### Behavior setting
Though the concept is a bit bloated and made more complex than need be it essentialy comes from this excerpt:
> we greatly restrict our behaviors to conform to the settings we enter.

Thus interestingly the "actual environment" allows for more behavior than is actually observed that people do in that environment, meaning that there are more **unseen** features present in the "environment". This can also be described as the situation, which is different from the features of an environment. Though, they call it behavior settings, indicating the link of behaviors and settings. Also notable is that the range of "allowed" behaviors in behavioral settings can be very limited resulting in little difference in individual behaviors. Thus Barkers views the situation as a predictor of behavior, but this neglect the fact that the situation is formed by the behaviors. If kids start chatting during a lecture then it breaks that situation where the teacher tries to teach the kids. Likely the teacher or the other kids will silence the chatters to preserve the situation. This links back to the self-regulating nature of behavorial settings Wicker describes, which is thus in conflict with the idea that the enviroment predicts behavior, as the environment is made by the self-regulating behavior. This also explains why behavior setings have synomorphic relationships, which means actions and objects fit compatibly togethers, since the setting is formed by the behavior, so naturally it will fit well. It also stated that these settings become living systems themselves, where the indivual persons can be replaced, have an maximum size, are self-regulating the individuals and even "die" when its individuals leave, all without explicit communication between its parts. This living system has to be maintained and that could be done with for example, deviation-countering mechanism, vetoing, monitoring or bringing others attention to the problem.
The pattern of smaller parts becoming a greater whole is very lifelike. This is also the case with these behavioral patterns, where smaller behavorial patterns from bigger behavorial patterns and so on. And also all of these being well structured, which is truly the wonder of life. Then how do you study such a `living system`? As Barker points out, it cannot be understood by looking at its parts. Often its individual parts do not even know there impact on the bigger whole, since it is simply not needed. Thus an third observer is needed, which views the system as a whole and not from the perspective of one its parts.



## Ecological Psychology- R.G. Barker
Interestingly it is still ecology here, which is about `the interrelationship of environment and organism`. 

> even geniuses think ordinary thoughts much of the time ...

Is geniusness a sprint? Does it lie in its application?

> In order to study enviroment-behavior relations on any level, the enviroment and the behavior must be described and measured independently; otherwise one becomes entangled in a tautological circle from which there is no escape.

It can only be an circle if there are two, so then an environment must exist for this to be true. So, what is this environment. Where does it begin, where does it end? How to define something without form? He says it is not in the life-space, but where does this environment go once the behavior changes. Is not gone? Then how can be there more?

## Environmental Psychology Behaviour and Experience in Context by T. Cassidy (Chapters 1 and 2)

The inivisible gestalt triangle can also be interpreted as an overlaid triange with the same color as the background, which is more likely to happen in real life since there are more basic shapes when interpreted that way.

... noting down many different attempts to interpret and apply environment as a concept.

## 0HM260_Handouts_Lecture_1
> our ecological environment has to be described independent of individuals and his or her behavior. 

Why? The behavior determines environment. Can something be more than a psychological variable? When you sleep, where is the environment?


Behavior -> Environment

- Dirty room
- Climate change
- Deforestation
- Classrooms

These are all not natural environments and come to be by human behavior for human behavior. Then why do we try to predict human behavior by the environment eventhough that is its maker. This environment influencing behavior is then just another humans behavior influencing another human indirectly through the environment. But that sounds more like social psychology. Though then you cannot really say it is an environment, because the other human is also just another part in the bigger system. When a tree provides you oxygen, do you just say he is part of the environment? Is this not also a interaction between the parts of the bigger whole?

How do you replicate any moment if not abstracted? Each moment in time is completely unique after all.

Note on Psychology as whole
How can psychology be made real? What is real? Common knowledge is that what we perceive is not real. Though I ask you, what more do you know then what you perceive or have perceived? Thus for psychology to become consistent and evolve, the perceived has to assumed to be always true. Then the problem becomes how to communicate perceptions in way that the interpreter actually understands what you say, since statements about perception can rarely be used as is, coming from an indiviual perspective.

The psychology of the individual as influenced by social presence.

## BEHAVIORAL STUDY OF OBEDIENCE - by S. MILGRAM (1963)
Why do people do bad things? Obedience of course and this research proves it, wow so shocking, everybody is in awe and can't believe it. Though likely rightfully so. 

 > "Obedience is as basic an element in the structure of social life as one can point to."

No it is not, trust is what you mean (honestly how can this be the first sentence). The rest of the paragraph is self-argumenting, as in that only this research "confirms it", thus it is circle-reasoning. 

> "These inhumane policies may have originated in the mind of a single person..."

Who would he mean hmm? But surely he was not the only one who had these policies in mind.

You only obey if you do not agree yourself with what is forced. This nevers holds out long without enforcement. This is even true in the military, where "obeying orders" is still based on trust.

### Method
Watch a documentry or online video about it, it is pretty populary covered. Or in short, ZAP -> AU!! -> PLEASE CONTINUE (not an order?) -> INCREASE VOLTAGE -> REPEAT UNTIL VICTIM DIES.

> Fourteen of the 40 subjects showed definite signs of nervous laughter and smiling. The laughter seemed entirely out of place, even bizarre.

Perhaps they found the acting not so convincing.

### Discussion
Author: WOW so shocking(lol) results, I did not see this coming at all, can you believe it, I did not do any weird science.

#### Nothing by Mere Authority: Evidence that in an Experimental Analogue of the Milgram Paradigm Participants are Motivated not by Orders but by Appeals to Science - by S.A. Haslam, S.D. Reicher, M.E. Birney (2014)
Or shorter: Implicit prodding vs ordering.

>Indeed, this instinct to obey is held responsible for the ease with which destructiveness and oppression become endemic within social systems (see Miller, 2004; Reicher & Haslam, 2011). Even bigger circle-reasoning now, it is often also not transparent where orders come from, underming possibilties for fact checking. 

>“You have no other choice, you ‘must’ go on” (Prod 4). As Burger (2009a) has observed, only the fourth of these prods clearly constitutes an order. Yet he also notes that in his own replications of the Milgram paradigm this prod proved to be the least successful of all in encouraging participants to continue.

>As part of a broader reinterpretation of Milgram’s findings and in line with previous research in the social identity tradition (Tajfel & Turner, 1979; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell, 1987), we have argued that ordering participants to continue is counterproductive because it positions the experimenter as an outsider who is acting against the participant.

Thus here trust is broken, because the reason is not ambigious anymore. Till then the reason is self-induced by the participant. This can for example be for Science as proposed in this paper, which makes sense in the setting.

##### Method
>The goal of the present experiment is to try to resolve these questions about
the role that prods play in determining whether or not participants continue owards the goals set out by the Experimenter. The principal way in which it does
this is by manipulating the prods between participants (rather than in a predetermined sequence) in order to examine the independent effect that each has upon participants’ willingness to follow experimental instructions

##### Discussion
> Across all conditions, the extent to which a prod made reference to scientific requirements also positively predicted continuation and completion, whereas being seen as an order was, if anything, a negative predictor of these outcomes.

Please don't ever do something you find deeply aversive. Make sure you are conscious of your reasons.


## The prosocial side of power: How structural power over subordinates can
promote social responsibility - by L, P, Tosta, H. H. Johnsonb (2019)

Over history how many times have the rich and powerful shared their resources? Though there is more to give, somehow they keep getting richer. This can only happen if you don't give, which is how they got rich in the first place of course. But when you have nothing it is easy to give, since you have nothing to give! So let's explore how social classes impact prosociality.

> Relative to their upper class counterparts, lower class individuals are more dependent on others to achieve their desired life outcomes, more cognizant of others in their social environment, and more likely to display other-oriented nonverbal behaviors (Kraus & Keltner, 2009; Kraus, Piff, & Keltner, 2009). These findings suggest that lower class individuals will act in a more prosocial fashion and do so because of an increased orientation to the needs of others, the central hypothesis guiding the four studies presented here.

We are in it together. Though upper classes seem to be more indepdent, they still rely on the lower class for their riches. I mean, they can't even be `upper class` without the existance of the lower class. Furthermore, they describe that lower class generally have more inclusive behavior in many studies.

>The hypothesis that those with less will tend to give more is inherently paradoxical.

Only in a logical world.

### Effects of social class & Methods
> To test the competing hypotheses outlined here, in four studies, we examined whether lower class individuals act in a more prosocial fashion than their upper class counterparts.

Study| Method | Dicussion
 --- | --- | --- 
 1. Generosity  | Dictator game (behavioral measure of altruism) | Lower class were more generous to strangers  of their relative socioeconomic rank.
 2. Charitable donations Discussion |  "how you think people should spend their annual salary?" survey with manipulation of participants’ perceptions | Lower class individuals show greater support for charity
3. Trust | Trust game (In this game, being trusting means that one must be willing to allocate points to their partner despite the risk of their partner defecting, thus benefiting others at a potential cost to the self.) | Lower class participants in the current study allocated more points to their partner in the trust game relative to upper class participants, and this tendency was explained by their social values oriented toward egalitarianism and the well-being of others. The current findings also held independent of participant age and ethnicity, once again indicating that social class exerts a unique influence on prosocial behavior.
4. Helping behavior | Confedarate late -> Distress -> How much time does participants spend to help? |  We found that lower class individuals were more likely than upper class individuals to help their distressed partners by taking on a more onerous portion of the experimental tasks. We also found evidence that feelings of compassion, rooted in a concern for others’ welfare, underlie class-based differences in prosocial behavior.

So for 4 examples of prosocial behavior the lower class showed more of it.
