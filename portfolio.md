## Native projects💻
Software sources are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/boukew99) and playable demos on [itch.io](https://howyoudoing.itch.io/). Generally I use the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) for native development for its small binary size and ease of use. I have made some repositories available on the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset?category=&godot_version=&sort=updated&filter=boukew99).


## Video Games🎮  
Most games are pretty experimental. sample: [Space Evader👾](https://itch.io/embed-upload/2869595?color=ebdf64).
During Game jams I made space games, topdown sawblade simulator, perception game, chicken🐔 farm sim, puzzle box, light☀️ puzzle, platformers🤸‍♀️.


## Web projects🕸️
I just use HTML, CSS & JS. I like the wide use case it serves. All project are on this website. [source](https://boukew99.github.io)
