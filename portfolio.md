I write software, music, drawings, papers...


My software is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/boukew99), which includes some MIT Projects. My software has a focus on User Experience, which I can also use when making videogames. These videogames are hosted on [Itch.io](https://howyoudoing.itch.io/) and [Newgrounds](https://howyourdoing.newgrounds.com/), which includes Game Jam games, demos and experiments. Generally I use the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) for development and also have made some repos available on the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset?category=&godot_version=&sort=updated&filter=boukew99). In the [log](log) you can stay up to date with what I am up to. In [project](#projects) I have a collection of most of my project on one page. I also keep a log of useful or interesting sites on [bookmarks](bookmarks). Or if your adventurous play this [text game](web_apps/text_adventure) on this site. I have [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HowYouD09409170), which I never use. Also a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5KGMXvW7Tg3emnWz5S2grT?si=328485d8732046a6)üéµ
